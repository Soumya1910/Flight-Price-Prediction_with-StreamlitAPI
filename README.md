# Flight Price Prediction Application 

## Table of Content


## Demo


## Overview
This is a simple Machine Learning Regression Prediction application build by using Streamlit API. 

## Motivation
Implementation is always good way of learning. As a part of ML engineering life cycle, this application is part of Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, Model Creation, Accuracy check and model Prediction. Here I have learnt streamlit api functionality and deploying in various cloud platforms.  

## User Input
User can predict approximate flight price by providinh required basic details like Preferred Airline, Source, Destination, Number of Stops, departure and arrival details.

## Installation
This code is written in Python 3.6. 

## Technical Aspect
This project is divided into three parts:
1. Model creation
	- Data Collection
	- Features 


Training model after doing data preprocessing and analyzing and creating model pickel file. [refer .ipynb file]
2. Predicting model by accessing trained pickel model.
3. Cloud deployment.
